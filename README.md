# Whac-A-Mole

This application represents a foundational and simplified iteration of the beloved childhood game "Whac-A-Mole." As one of my early ventures into JavaScript development, certain coding practices may not reach top-tier standards. However, this project serves as a testament to the seamless integration of event-driven gameplay with rudimentary yet effective animation and sound design, resulting in a delightful user experience. Centered around the iconic Mario theme, the game challenges users to adeptly strike the mole while deftly avoiding menacing Piranhas, all in pursuit of achieving a new high score. Thank you, enjoy!
